            <h2>What</h2>
            <img class="centreimage" src="assets/dotcom/email1.png">
            <p>So I received this email about 4 days ago.</p>
            <p>
                It contained no contact information except the email it was sent from, 
                and got marked as spam for some reason, but it brought to my attention 
                that wilburwilliams.com was now available.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, the reason this website is wilburwilliams.uk is because the .com 
                wasn't available and I wasn't really sure what I wanted so .uk seemed like 
                a safe option.
            </p>
            <p>
                In case you're wondering, here's what the site <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231101073034/https://wilburwilliams.com/">used to look like</a>:
            </p>
            <img class="centreimage" src="assets/dotcom/oldwwcom.png">
            <p>
                In my dad's own words, a "handsome American black man".
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm not sure why it was gone, the but it hadn't changed in a while so the other 
                Wilbur Williams behind it probably didn't care about it anymore and let the 
                domain expire.

            <h2>So, what are you going to do with it then?</h2>
            <p>
                As you've probably guess by now, I've bought the domain. 
                Despite the email about it, I just had to buy it through CF registrar.
                This was what made the email weird, along with it being in spam, 
                but I'll chalk it up to the emailer just being a nice guy.
            </p>
            <p>
                I don't really know what I'll do with it, but if you have any suggestions 
                feel free to message me!
