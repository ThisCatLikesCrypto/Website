    <h1>What is AI?</h1>
    <h2>Narrow AI (both simple and advanced)</h2>
    <h6>terrible styling yes (it's about the content!)</h6>
    <p>Simple Narrow AI excels at specific tasks. Imagine it as a specialised helper that's really good at one thing.
        For instance, it could be an AI recommending products on Amazon, suggesting videos on YouTube, or even
        identifying images, fonts, or handwriting. These AIs are like focused experts—they do their job well, but
        they're not versatile. Creating and training them is relatively straightforward, and anyone with the right
        knowledge can code one. More Advanced Narrow AI, on the other hand, aims to mimic human responses. Think of
        chatbots or image generators. These sophisticated AIs learn from vast amounts of data, attempting to replicate
        human-like behavior. They’re harder to create, but they operate in a similar way. So, while simple narrow AIs
        are like specialized tools, advanced narrow AIs strive to help us with a huge variety of things.</p>
    <h2>Future AGI</h2>
    <p>Artificial General Intelligence, or AGI, seeks to create machines that mimic or emulate human intelligence and
        behavior. These systems possess the ability to learn, reason, and apply their intelligence to solve diverse
        problems. This is because it is not limited to a single domain or task. Instead, it exhibits a broad spectrum of
        cognitive abilities, allowing it to tackle various challenges. AGI can transfer knowledge and skills from one
        context to another. It doesn’t merely excel in a predefined set of tasks but can generalize its understanding to
        new scenarios. This also means that they are extremely adaptable and act like super-humans. However, the
        development of AGI remains a subject of ongoing debate. Researchers and experts differ in their predictions
        regarding the timeline for achieving AGI. Some believe it could happen within years or decades, while others
        argue it might take a century or longer. There’s even a minority view that AGI may never be fully realised.
        Despite the challenges, AGI holds immense promise. It could revolutionise fields such as healthcare, robotics,
        natural language understanding, and scientific research. However, ethics and safety are crucial as we navigate
        the journey toward creating machines with human-like intelligence.</p>
