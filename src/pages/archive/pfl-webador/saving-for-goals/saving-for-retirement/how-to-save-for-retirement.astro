                                                need to retire. This article will focus on saving for
                                                retirement.&nbsp;</span><span style=color:#4e3ac4></span></p>
                                        <p><span style=color:#4e3ac4>Most financial advisers will recommend a 15% -
                                                20% savings rate to retire at a normal age such as 65. You can
                                                increase or decrease this by a couple of percent if you are younger
                                                or older than this article assumes (30). You may have to as much as
                                                double this if you are 40+.</span></p>

                                        <p><span style=color:#4e3ac4>Well, I'm not a registered financial adviser so
                                                take this as information, but the most popular investment for
                                                retirement is probably the S&amp;P 500. It has averaged 9.8% growth
                                                yearly (with dividends reinvested) over the last 90 years, however
                                                it's usually best assume slightly less, say 7%.&nbsp;</span></p>
