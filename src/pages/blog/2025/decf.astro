        <h1 class="centretext">De-Cloudflareing</h1>
        <p class="centretext"><i>2025-03-23</i></p>
        <h2>Intro</h2>
        <p>
            Over the past few months I've been taking more and more things off 
            of cloudflare. This includes my website, DNS, and domains.
        </p>
        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <p>
            While I actually love Cloudflare, I've been moving off of it for 
            two reasons:
            <ol>
                <li>It's based in America, and I'm in the UK. I don't want to 
                    be supporting a Trumpian America and I don't really trust 
                    the US anymore, either. I don't want to be so tied down to
                    them.</li>
                <li>I'm uh... <i>technically</i> breaking TOS for being under 
                    18. I didn't actually realise this when signing up, but it's probably 
                    a smart idea to _not_ break TOS, y'know?</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <h2>What?</h2>
        <p>
            So far, this is what I've migrated:
            <ol>
                <li>Domains. This includes aqasbasement.uk, c48.uk, this domain, grid.me.uk, 
                    and pretty much everything except peppahack.dev (which I won't renew).
                </li>
                <li>DNS. Obviously with Cloudflare registrar your domains are tied to Cloudflare's 
                    DNS, however this is not the case with other registrars. At the moment grid.me.uk 
                    and aqasbasement.uk are still on Cloudflare's DNS, but I'm going to move them at some point.
                </li>
                <li>Websites. Cloudflare Pages still hosts wilburwilliams.com, grid.me.uk and aqasbasement.uk, but everything 
                    else is off of there.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <h2>Where to?</h2>
        <p>
            There's quite a few different providers now. Domains are simple, they're on <a href="https://www.netim.com">Netim</a>. 
            The reasoning for this is that they're French-based, so not American, and I'm not breaking TOS by being under 18.<br>
            DNS for jasperweb.uk is on Netim, but everything else that's moved is on <a href="https://gcore.com">GCore</a>'s DNS.
            GCore are Luxembourgish and therefore I'm alright with them being a critical part of my infrastructure.<br>
            This website uses <a href="https://melina.srv.c48.uk">this server</a> for hosting, and GCore's CDN in front of it.<br>
            Lots of other stuff including jasperweb.uk and eyescary sites are on <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a>. 
            While I know GitHub is American, I'm not paying them, and I can easily move to a different host in under 30 minutes.<br>
            <a href="https://assets.c48.uk">assets.c48.uk</a> is a new domain I created during migrations for assets, with the backend 
            being melina.srv.c48.uk again. This is through Amazon CloudFront, and I'm using that for the sole purpose of making 
            them pay very small amounts of money whenever someone loads I page I made :D
        </p>
        <h2>How much does this cost?</h2>
        <p>
            I'm paying about Â£6 more a year per .uk I migrate, but all of GCore's services I'm using are free and GH Pages is free.
        </p>
        <h2>What's next?</h2>
        <p>
            I'm not sure when grid.me.uk and aqasbasement.uk will be moved, but I'm going to move them at some point. Because domains 
            for those have moved to Netim, I feel a lot safer keeping them on Cloudflare since I can easily move them to a different 
            host quickly, if required.<br>
            I don't think I'll host either of those sites on melina.srv.c48.uk, so I think I'll end up using Netlify or Vercel or Azure 
            Static Web Apps or something.<br>
            If I ever get enough traffic to make it so I need to pay, I'll likely use <a href="https://bunny.net">bunny.net</a> as they've 
            slowly become my favourite provider, and they're Slovenia-based.
