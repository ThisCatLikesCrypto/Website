        <h2>Welcome!</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to the homepage for my mirror service. This page contains some stats and information about my mirrors.<br>
            Currently two servers make up the service, one to service the UK (Sathonyia) and one for Germany (Melina).<br>
            Sathonyia is considered the "main" server, although they have the same specs and Melina seems to receive more traffic 
            (excluding ubuntu releases, which I haven't mirrored on Melina so I can use bandwidth for other things, like assets.c48.uk).
        </p>
        <h3>tf is a mirror?</h3>
        <p>
            - A mirror is a copy of some files, usually for an open-source project, that is kept up-to-date with the original copy.<br>
            - Mirrors are used to distribute the files to users, and are throughout the world, so with enough mirrors there should 
            always be a local copy near you.<br>
            - They also reduce the load on the original server, and are pretty much always volunteer operations, which spreads the cost 
            too.<br>
            - This service is privately funded by me (and costs about ~Â£14/month to keep running), but the vast majority of mirrors are 
            hosted by hosting companies and universities. I'm just an exception because I felt like it and I thought it was a cool project 
            idea (it was, btw, and I use the servers for a few other things as well now).<br>
            - It's also nice because I get to contribute to projects that I use (for example, I actually use 
            <a href="https://archlinux.org/mirrors/c48.uk">my own Arch mirror</a> pretty much daily).

        <h2>Servers</h2>
        <p>
            Both servers are <a href="https://contabo.com" target="_blank">Contabo</a> Storage VPS 1 instances. Their specs are as follows:
            <ul>
                <li>200mbps bandwidth (32TB per month "limit", before it slows to 100mbps. I've got close, but never passed it.)</li>
                <li>2vCPU cores (which i've found to be <i>just about</i> fast enough)</li>
                <li>3GB RAM</li>
                <li>800GB (SATA) SSD (I've been fairly surprised at how much traffic I get with only a small amount of projects)</li>
                <li>Ubuntu Server</li>
            </ul>
            You can't actually buy the exact specs that I'm using anymore, but there's fairly similar packages you can get.

        <h2>FAQs</h2>
        <p>
            Q: Why are there two locations? Surely one would allow you to better service that region?<br>
            A: Yeah so funny story I was actually just going to get a server in Germany from <a href="https://hetzner.com">Hetzner</a>
            and use that to host my website, assets.c48.uk, etc, and deliberately get less storage to stop myself from inevitably
            turning it into another mirror service. Then Hetzner wouldn't let me have an account because I was under 18, so instead 
            I rented another Contabo server, and, well...
        </p>
        <p>
            Q: Why are you using Contabo?<br>
            A: Two reasons, I'll start with price. They're reliable <i>enough</i> and while some stuff breaks (like VNC goes down a lot 
            for some reason for me), for the storage and bandwidth I'm getting, it's a <i>very</i> good deal. The other reason is that 
            you don't have to be over 18 according to their ToS, so I can actually use it (lmao).
