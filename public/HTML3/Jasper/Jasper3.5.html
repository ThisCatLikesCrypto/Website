    <h3> History </h3>
    <div>
    The Pasmoium Kingdom was founded in 706 AD along the Asniom River by refugees (led by Dvontu Dastab) from the <a href="#">Tslind</a> (S-l-ind) Breakdown (A war of many revolts that led to the collapse of the 1st Tslind Empire). Dvontu Dastab became the King after he lead them to this new land. He ruled for 30 years with his wife Chanin Sutiyuq (Sooty-uck) and had 3 children: Parjave (Par - have) born in 721, Jupanaka (Jump - an - ack - her), and Arsuña. Arsuña inherited the throne after Dvontu died and ruled fairly. He implemented a court system with supposedly neutral judges (the first proper court system on the continent). In 751 AD, he died and was replaced by Jupanaka, a harsh and vicious ruler.
