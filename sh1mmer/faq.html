I don't have a USB drive. Can you send me one?
</h3> <p>
No.
</p> <hr> <h3>
I accidentally bought SH1mmer, what do I do?
</h3> <p>
If you find a place selling SH1mmer (or you buy a copy of SH1mmer),
        please get a refund as soon as you can. Read <a href="/sh1mmer/scam" target="_self">Scams</a> for more details.
</p> <hr> <h3>
I don't have admin perms on my personal computer. What do I do?
</h3> <p>
You can always try to find a permission bypass, or just ask a friend to
        write the USB drive for you (assuming you have any).
</p> <hr> <h3>
My board name isn't on the list. What do I do?
</h3> <p>
Call your chromebook manufacturer and demand they 
        give you the shim (not actual advice, this won't work.)
</p> <hr> <h3>
Is my school going to arrest me for doing this?
</h3> <p>
...no, but they can probably take away your Chromebook perms if they
        find out. Check your district's Technology agreement just to be sure.
</p> <p>
The only person who could potentially tell if you unenroll is the person
        in charge of the Google Admin console, but only if they specifically
        check your device. It will show as "offline" and nothing more, although
        they might get suspicious after a very long time.
</p> <p>
If you play it safe and not stupid, you will probably be fine.
</p> <hr> <h3>
My USB drive only has 2GB. Can I still do this?
</h3> <p>
Yeah, it's pretty easy. All you need to do is to obtain three more USB 
        drives of the same size, and put them onto a crafting table.
</p> <p>
(I was gonna delete this as it is actually possible now, 
        but it's funny so I'll leave it.)
</p> <hr> <h3>
Why does it say that my USB doesn't contain ChromeOS?
</h3> <p>
You probably downloaded the wrong board, developer mode isn't on, or your
        USB drive is faulty.
</p> <hr> <h3>
The file download is slow. Can you give me a faster one?
</h3> <p>
Shim files average around 5GB, so no. Since this is <a href="https://dl.osu.bio">osu.bio</a>, the download speeds are already as good as they get, because it's 
        hosted on OneDrive. If the downloads are shit, then get better internet. Skid.
</p><hr> <h3>
What does skid mean?
</h3> <p>
Sorry, what does <kbd>62.34.241.128</kbd> mean?
</p> <hr> <h3>
I can't re-enroll.
</h3> <p>
If the "Re-Enroll Device" option (Beautiful World GUI only) doesn't work,
        then try booting into ChromeOS and then logging into your school account.
        If it still doesn't work, then #RIPBOZO.
</p> <hr> <h3>
My Chromebook is bricked!
</h3> <p>
This is very rare and if this does happen to you then you're a fucking
        dumbass. Seriously, there is nothing we can do. All you can do is
        get a new Chromebook from your workplace or school.
</p> <hr> <h3>
How do I get WiFi passwords?
</h3> <p>
Use the netlog password extractor, you can find it on the main page.
</p> <hr> <h3>
Where do I download a shim?
</h3> <p>
Okay, if I... if I chop you up in a meat grinder, and the only thing
        that comes out, that's left of you, is your eyeball, you'r- you're
        PROBABLY DEAD! You're probably going to - not you, I'm just sayin',
        like, if you- if somebody were to, like, push you into a meat grinder,
        and, like, your- one of your finger bones is still intact, they're not
        gonna pick it up and go, "Well see, yeah it wasn't deadly, it wasn't an
        instant kill move! You still got, like, this part of your finger left!"
        NO I'M NOT GONNA PUT YOU INTO A MEAT GRINDER. I'M NOT GONNA PUT YOU INTO
        A MEAT GRINDER. NO. I'm making a reference to the fact that, like, if I,
        like, if I were to get fucking KILLED... I don't know, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M
        SAYIN'. If- if- okay, if you were to- okay we're gonna take humans out
        of this, if alien Globgobglobgo 1 fuckin' shoots a disintegrating ray at
        alien Globglo 2, if there's only fucking TEETH LEFT, it's- it's fucking
        you're dead, you're dead. "If I were to put you in a meat grinder,"
        goddamnit, it's so fucked up! You understand what I'm sayin' though, I'm
        not actually saying that I'm going to put somebody in a meat grinder,
        goddamnit. Whatever.

The website is down!
</h3> <p>
Be patient. Also how the FUCK are you visiting this page if it's down?
</p> <hr> <h3>
It says I am using an unofficial image.
</h3> <p>
You're using a recovery image and not an injected shim. How in the FUCK
        did you get the instructions THIS fucking wrong? You actual fucking dumbass
        and skid.
</p> <hr> <h3>
I can't build on Windows Subsystem for Linux.
</h3> <p>
Try moving the shim file to be on the WSL filesystem (instead of in /mnt/c).
</p> <hr> <h3>
The shim is displaying a QR code and asking for an authorization code.
</h3> <p>
That is not something we put in. You are using a raw shim. Please follow the
        instructions correctly, cause you clearly aren't, dumbass.
</p> <hr> <h3>
Why did I read all this?
</h3> <p>
No idea. You should probably go get a life.
