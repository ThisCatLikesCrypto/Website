Shady Hardware 1nstrument Makes Machine Enrollment Retreat
</p> </div> <div class="section blue"> <h3>What is SH1mmer?</h3> <p>
SH1mmer is an exploit capable of completely unenrolling
      enterprise-managed Chromebooks. It was found by the
<a href="https://mercurywork.shop">Mercury Workshop team</a> and was
      released on January 13th, 2023. For more info, check out the
<a href="https://coolelectronics.me/blog/breaking-cros-2">Writeup</a> by
      CoolElectronics.
</p> <br> <h4>
If this isn't working for you, check
<a href="#fog" target="_self">"The Fog"</a>
section below.
</h4> </div> <div class="section green"> <h3>What you will need</h3> <li> <u onclick="alert(messages.drives); ">A USB drive or SD card;</u>
required for booting into SH1mmer
</li> <li> <u onclick="alert(messages.pc); ">A Computer or Chromebook;</u>
note that you need admin perms on Windows/MacOS
</li> <hr> <h3>Writing to a USB</h3> <p>
First, you'll need to find your managed Chromebook's board name. This
      can be done by going to <kbd>chrome://version</kbd> on your Chromebook
      and copying the word after <kbd>stable-channel</kbd>, or with
<u onclick="alert(messages.board); ">a variety of other methods</u>.
</p> <p>
If your board name is in the list below, your board has a publicly
      leaked RMA shim. If it's not, you'll have to source it on your own...
      somehow.
</p>
ambassador, brask, brya, clapper, coral, corsola, dedede, enguarde, 
    glimmer, grunt, hana, hatch, jacuzzi, kukui, lulu, nami, octopus, 
    orco, pyro, reks, sentry, stout, strongbad, tidus, ultima, volteer, zork
<p>
First you need to download a SH1mmer bin at
<a href="https://dl.osu.bio">dl.osu.bio</a><br>
Then build an injected shim using your bin at the
<a href="/sh1mmer/builder" target="_self">SH1mmer Web Builder</a><br>
Once you've obtained a INJECTED SHIM (NOT A RAW SHIM), you can continue.
</p> <p>
Download the
<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pocpnlppkickgojjlmhdmidojbmbodfm">
Chromebook Recovery Utility</a>
extension on your personal computer as well.
</p> <p>
Once the downloads are complete,
<u onclick="alert(messages.launch);">launch the recovery utility</u>
and plug your USB drive into your personal computer.
</p> <i>IMPORTANT: Your USB drive will be completely erased and partitioned.</i> <p>
In the recovery utility window, click the settings icon (⚙) and press
      "Use local image".
</p> <img src="/sh1mmer/assets/recovery_utility.webp" alt="Chromebook Recovery Utility"> <p>
Select your injected shim file, identify your USB, and start the writing
      process. This will take about 10 minutes.
</p> <i>NOTE: You can also use a tool such as Rufus, BalenaEtcher, or Win32DiskImager
      to flash on Windows, as these often work better than the Chromebook Recovery
      Utility. If you're on Linux, <kbd>dd</kbd> is recommended.</i> <hr> <h3>Executing on Chromebook</h3> <p>
Once writing is complete, enter recovery mode on your Chromebook. This
      is done by pressing the power button (⏻), reload key (↻), and ESC key at
      the same time. Your screen should look one of the images below:
</p> <img src="/sh1mmer/assets/recover_black.webp" alt="Recovery mode (groot UI)"> <img src="/sh1mmer/assets/recover_white.webp" alt="Recovery mode (old UI)"> <p>Press <kbd>CTRL + D</kbd> on this screen, then press enter.</p> <p>
It will now say something about "Confirm returning to secure mode" or
      that "OS verification is OFF". You will not actually be in dev mode, 
      but the exploit will work regardless. Your screen should look like 
      one of the images below:
</p> <img src="/sh1mmer/assets/confirm_black.webp" alt="TONORM (groot UI)"> <img src="/sh1mmer/assets/confirm_white.webp" alt="TONORM+FWMP (old UI)"> <p>
On this screen, press the power button (⏻), reload key (↻), and ESC key
      at the same time again! This is very important and cannot be skipped.
</p> <p>
Once it re-shows the original recovery screen, plug your shimmed USB
      into your Chromebook, and press the power button (⏻), reload key (↻),
      and ESC key again. After a brief black-and-white loading screen, you
      should be in the SH1mmer menu.
</p> <img src="/sh1mmer/assets/utils-select01.webp" alt="SH1MMER Beautiful World UI"> <p>Play around with the UI, exit, and reboot.</p> <hr> <h3>What now?</h3> <p>
You will now be able to, among other things, unenroll your Chromebook.
      It will now behave entirely as if it is a personal computer and no
      longer contain spyware or blocker extensions.
</p> <p>
Note that while unenrolled, it is recommended to add your personal
      account first, then add your school account, then switch between the two
      as needed. Mercury Workshop does not condone the use of SH1mmer or
      unenrolling to cheat in school.
</p> <p>
The biggest challenges with unenrolling are connecting to the school
      network and taking state or national exams (since there are no kiosk
      apps anymore).
</p> <p>
There are many methods to get a school Wi-Fi password while enrolled,
      including
<a href="https://luphoria.com/netlog-policy-password-tool">the policy netlog trick</a>. While on a school account and unenrolled, you can bypass some network-level 
      blocks by using a secure DNS such as Cloudflare 1.1.1.1 from
<kbd>chrome://os-settings/osPrivacy</kbd>. It is also recommended to
      enable "MAC address randomization" in <kbd>chrome://flags</kbd> to stay
      hidden.
</p> <img src="/sh1mmer/assets/secure_dns.webp" alt="Secure DNS"> <img src="/sh1mmer/assets/mac_randomization.webp" alt="MAC Address Randomization"> <p>
To take a kiosk exam, the safest option is to re-enroll temporarily.
      Instructions are hosted here: <a href="/sh1mmer/kiosk" target="_self">Kiosk</a> </p>
or alternatively, the original text file (for local copies): <a href="/sh1mmer/files/kiosk.txt" target="_self">Kiosk.txt</a> <p>
You can also use <a href="https://github.com/MercuryWorkshop/fakemurk">fakemurk</a> as a way to enroll your device but stay in developer mode 
      and have control over policies and extensions. You may need to use this 
      to get WiFi passwords if <kbd>chrome://net-export</kbd> is blocked.
</p> <hr> <div id="fog"> <h3>The Fog...</h3> <h4>(Google's response, and why this might not be working for you)</h4> <p>
Downgrading and unenrollment has been patched* by Google. If your
        Chromebook has never updated to version 112 before (check in
<kbd>chrome://version</kbd>), then you can ignore this and follow the
        normal instructions. If not, unenrollment will not work as normal.
</p> <p>
If you aren't willing to take apart your Chromebook to unenroll, you
        can use an affiliated project,
<a href="https://fog.gay">E-HALCYON</a>, to boot into a deprovisioned
        environment temporarily.
