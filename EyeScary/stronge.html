        <h3>we're out here making notepad look like an IDE</h3>
        <p>NEWS!: Stronge 0.2 is out now! files are now no longer overwritten when opened again, and</p>

    <div class="main">
        <p>Stronge is a minimal code editor written in Python</p>
        <h2>Features:</h2>
        <p>Write to any file type</p>
        <p>if your code is in ESDlang you can execute it with our built in interpreter!</p>
        <p>Better not make any errors, you can't change a previous line!</p>
        <h2>Can I download it?</h2>
        <p>sure, the latest preview is available below:</p>
        <a href="../dl/download.html?fileName=Stronge_v0.2.zip"><button id="buttonlt">Download v0.2 preview here</button></a>
        <p>when you launch stronge, it will prompt you to come up with a filename, then a file extension, put your chosen file extension here or leave the input blank for .txt, then get to writing code! to clear a file, type filclr on a new line, to save a file and exit, type savex on a new line, and to run your ESDLang code, type savrun on a new line</p>
        <p><br>looking for something new? how about Stronge 0.3? using the ins command, you can now edit previous lines in this version, and we added line numbers! This is however a beta product due to some janky code used for editing previous lines, if your code constantly refreshes every time you enter a line, it's because of how we had to manage editing the file</p>
        <a href="../dl/download.html?fileName=Stronge_v0.3.zip"><button>Download version 0.3 preview here</button></a>
        <p>formatting the ins command: type ins, space and then the line number you would like to ammend, 2 colons will pop up and this is where you write your amended line</p>
