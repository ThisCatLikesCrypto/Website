        <h2>Variables</h2>
        <p>Variables are created in a very simple way. You write 'var' (newline), [variableName] (newline) and then the type. Currently num and str are supported types. on the next line you give the final piece of information about the varable, it's value</p>
        <esd>var<br>coolvariable<br>str<br>(value)</esd>
        <p>Variables can have numbers subtracted or added to them, provided they are formatted as a number when initially made, it looks like this</p>
        <esd>var<br>supercoolnumber<br>num<br>12<br> write the current value of the number is supercoolnumber<br>var<br>supercoolnumber<br>num<br>-11<br>write oh no! the value of the number has dropped to supercoolnumber</esd>
        <p>Do note however, you cannot change the size of a variable by a radnom or an input</p>
        <h2>Writing and Input</h2>
        <p>Writing is done by typing 'write' and then any other text on that line is treated as what to output.
           Variables are automatically converted to their values. For example:
        </p>
        <esd>write The value of the variable is coolvariable.</esd>
        <p>Input is done a similar way. You write 'input ' and then everything afterwards is treated as what to write. The data will be saved to a var initalised previously.</p>
        <esd>var<br>yourname<br>str<br>input Hello, enter your name: <br>write Welcome to this program, yourname</esd>
        <h2>If/Else statements</h2>
        <p>If/else statements are defined by writing if and then a value, then a condition (=,>=,<=,>,<,x(not equal to)) and then another value, with spaces in between of course. You write your if-statement affected code below the if statement. Then when you're ready, write else on a new line and write your code for if those conditions aren't true, close up the statement with endstat. if you just want an if statement, just leave the else line empty (you still need endstat).</p>
        <esd>if ex = test<br>write The var is equal to test!<br>else<br>write The var is not equal to test!<br>endstat</esd>
        <h2>Random Numbers</h2>
        <p>Random numbers are created using radnom and with the newest update to ESDlang, you can now make them as big as you want instead of the max being 9, here's how to make a variable that is a random number</p>
        <esd>var<br>supercoolnumber<br>num<br>radnom 23 67<br>write your age is supercoolnumber</esd>
