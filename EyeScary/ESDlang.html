        <h1>ESDlang</h1>
        <p>a simple programming language with a minimal syntax, currently in v3.0 closed testing</p>
        <p>NEWS!: ESDLang version 3.0 has arrived! with all new if/else statements now available</p>

        <h2>What would coding with it look like?</h2>
        <p>ESDlang is a programming language like very few, no brackets, quotes or tags are needed here! the first word
            you type is always a reserved word, anything after that is just requirements for a function which can be
            <i>anything</i>. <br> <br> Here's how some basic code might look:</p>
        <p id="esd">
            <br>
            write hello<br>
            var<br>
            er<br>
            str<br>
            input what is your name?: <br>
            write hello, er , have a good day!<br><br>
            This code produces: <br>
            hello<br>
            what is your name?: (name) <br>
            hello, (name) , have a good day!
        </p>
        <p>
            <br>
            Features currently not working: <br><br>
            Variable names can only be 2 letters<br>
            Punctuation has to be separate from a variable for a variable to register<br>
            Random numbers can only go up to 9
        </p>
        <h2>Can I download a preview?</h2>
        <p>Sure, download it here:</p>
        <a href="../dl/download.html?fileName=ESDlang.zip"><button id="buttonlt">Download v3.0 preview</button></a>
        <p>when you extract the zip, edit the file named trun.txt, this is where you write your code</p>
        <p>to create a variable make a line with var on, then give the variable a name on the next line, pick between
            num or str for your variable type and then give it a value (example values: radnom 2 3 , input input value
            here: , this is a string , 6)</p>
        <p>to write a line of text, type write, then space and then write what you want to write, variable names are
            automatically converted to their values upon printing</p>
        <p>if/else statements are defined by writing if and then a value, then a condition (=,>=,<=,>,<,x(not equal to)) and then another value, with spaces in between of course. then when you're ready, write else on a new line and write your code for if those conditions aren't true, close up the statement with endstat. if you just want an if statement, just leave the else line empty</p>
