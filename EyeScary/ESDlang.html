        <h2>What would coding with it look like?</h2>
        <p>ESDlang is a programming language like very few, no brackets, quotes or tags are needed here! the first word
            you type is always a reserved word, anything after that is just requirements for a function which can be <i>anything</i>. 
        <br><br> 
        Here's how some basic code might look:
        </p>
        <p>
        <esd>
            write hello<br>
            var<br>
            er<br>
            str<br>
            input what is your name?: <br>
            write hello, er , have a good day!<br><br>
            This code produces: <br>
            hello<br>
            what is your name?: (name) <br>
            hello, (name) , have a good day!
        </esd>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Features currently not working: <br><br>
            Punctuation has to be separate from a variable for a variable to register<br>
        </p>
        <h2>Can I download a preview?</h2>
        <p>Sure, download it here:</p>
        <a href="../dl/download.html?fileName=ESDlang.zip"><button class="buttonlt">Download v3.5 preview</button></a>
        <p>when you extract the zip, edit the file named trun.txt, this is where you write your code</p>
        <h2>But how?</h2>
