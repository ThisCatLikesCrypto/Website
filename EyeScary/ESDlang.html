    <h1>ESDlang (formerly weardlang, references still visible)</h1>
    <p>a simple programming language with a minimal syntax, currently in v2.0 closed testing</p>
    <h2>What would coding with it look like?</h2>
    <p>ESDlang is a programming language like very few, no brackets, quotes or tags are needed here! the first word you type is always a reserved word, anything after that is just requirements for a function which can be <i>anything</i>. <br> <br> Here's how some basic code might look:</p>
    <p class="esd"><br>write hello<br>var<br>er<br>str<br>input what is your name?: <br>write hello, er , have a good day!<br><br>This code produces: <br>hello<br>what is your name?: (name) <br>hello, (name) , have a good day!</p>
    <p><br>Features currently not working: <br><br>Variable names can only be 2 letters<br>Punctuation has to be separate from a variable for a variable to register<br>Random numbers can only go up to 9</b></p>
    <h2>Can I download a preview?</h2>
    <p>Sure, download it here:</p>
    <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/xrz6ezygiw712z0wn1swl/ESDlang.zip?rlkey=kgrwa7zqbabdq7xexzm8n5qlr&dl=0"><button class="buttonlt">Download v2.0 preview</button></a>
    <p>when you extract the zip, edit the file named trun.txt, this is where you write your code</p>
    <p>to create a variable make a line with var on, then give the variable a name on the next line, pick between num or str for your variable type and then give it a value (example values: radnom 2 3 , input input value here: , this is a string ,  6)</p>
    <p>to write a line of text, type write, then space and then write what you want to write, variable names are automatically converted to their values upon printing</p>
