      <h3>Best Workstation CPU</h3>
      <p>FlyingCPU W Í6 6666XE, priced £400</p>
      <img src=images/FlyingCPU.png>
      <p>This CPU is a great workstation CPU, scoring over 23000 points in Cinebench multi-core. It has 18 cores, which
        is great for multi-threaded applications, such as rendering video or compliling programs.</p>
      <h3>Best Gaming CPU</h3>
      <p>HyperCPU Yeze H77, priced £320</p>
      <img src=images/HyperCPU.jpg>
      <p>This CPU is a great gaming CPU. It scores 16000 points in Cinebench, and while this isn't as much as the
        FlyingCPU, it gets over double its FPS in most games, thanks to its 10 cores being much faster per core than the
        FlyingCPU's.</p>
      <h3>Best Value CPU</h3>
      <p>ASR Va3, priced £160</p>
      <img src=images/ASR_Va3.jpg>
      <p>This CPU is an amazing value option, scoring 9000 Cinebench points, while coming it at only £160. This is one
        of the best value CPUs we've ever seen! It will work great in your basic PC, or even for some medium-load gaming
        or photo editing, but will not work for those who want to get the most out of their PC.</p>
